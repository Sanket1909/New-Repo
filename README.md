# New-Repo
The outer for loop iterates through each row.
Here we use two counters count and count1 for printing the spaces and numbers respectively.
The inner for loop prints the required spaces using formula (rows-i)+1, where rows is the total number of rows and i is the current row number.
The while loop prints the numbers where 2 * i - 1 gives the number of items in each row.

Output:Enter number of rows: 7
